Angular gives use the JSON representation of the HTML form.

Here we have two approaches to handle forms:
- **Template Driven Approach** (Angular infers the FORM object from the DOM)
- **Reactive Approach** (Form is created programatically and synchronized with the DOM)

**NOTE:** We don't use "**action**" on the form here as we are not going to directly submit it to the server.
Rather we will handle it using angular and sent it to server via Angular's HTTP methods.
